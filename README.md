So the first release is done. Now I am wanting to improve it. First of all, I need to fix a bug where the previous generated identity just stayed there unless you pressed "Clear". I'll make an emergency fix today. Then I might add a dark theme. After all that been fixed, I will start for a more precise name generation, with surname, and the name's history matching the born location. It is not necessary though. I'm just making this for fun. Maybe later I'll even add a postal code generation.
